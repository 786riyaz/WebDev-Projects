# Documentation for Trading, Exchanges, Delta Exchange, and API Integration

## Purpose
This document provides a beginner-friendly explanation of trading, exchanges, digital currency, and Delta Exchange, with a focus on the Delta Exchange API (https://docs.delta.exchange/). It is designed for a developer building a website that integrates with Delta Exchange, covering key concepts and technical details for implementation.

## 1. Key Concepts

### 1.1 Trading
- **Definition**: Trading is the act of buying and selling financial assets (e.g., cryptocurrencies) to make a profit or manage risk based on price changes.
- **Key Terms**:
  - **Buy/Sell Orders**: Instructions to purchase or sell an asset at a specific price (limit order) or current market price (market order).
  - **Price Volatility**: Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate rapidly, creating opportunities and risks.
- **Developer Relevance**: The website must allow users to:
  - Place buy/sell orders.
  - View real-time market data (e.g., prices, order books).
  - Check account details (e.g., balances, trade history).

### 1.2 Exchanges
- **Definition**: An exchange is a digital platform that facilitates trading by matching buyers and sellers, processing transactions, and ensuring security.
- **Functions**:
  - Matches buy/sell orders.
  - Provides price data and market information.
  - Manages user accounts and funds securely.
- **Developer Relevance**: The website will interact with an exchange’s API to fetch data, execute trades, and manage user accounts.

### 1.3 Digital Currency (Cryptocurrency)
- **Definition**: Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) are decentralized digital assets on blockchain technology, secure and independent of central banks.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Decentralized**: No single authority controls transactions.
  - **Secure**: Transactions are encrypted and recorded on a blockchain.
  - **Volatile**: Prices can change rapidly, impacting trading.
- **Developer Relevance**: The website may need to:
  - Display crypto prices and market data.
  - Handle deposits/withdrawals of cryptocurrencies.
  - Show transaction histories or wallet balances.

### 1.4 Delta Exchange
- **Overview**: Delta Exchange is a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, primarily India-focused, offering advanced trading products.
- **Products**:
  - **Futures**: Contracts to buy/sell a cryptocurrency at a future date and price.
  - **Perpetual Swaps**: Futures-like contracts without an expiration date.
  - **Options**: Contracts giving the right (not obligation) to buy/sell at a specific price by a date.
  - **Spot Trading**: Buying/selling actual cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC/USDT).
  - **MOVE Options**: Contracts betting on price volatility, not direction.
- **Unique Features**:
  - **Leverage**: Trade with borrowed funds (up to 100x), amplifying profits/losses.
  - **INR Settlement**: Trades settle in Indian Rupees, avoiding crypto-specific taxes in India.
  - **Security**: Enterprise-grade measures to protect user funds.
- **Developer Relevance**: The website must integrate with Delta Exchange’s API to support these products, display data, and enable trading.

## 2. Delta Exchange API (https://docs.delta.exchange/)

### 2.1 Overview
- The Delta Exchange API is a REST and WebSocket-based interface for programmatic interaction with the platform.
- **REST API**: Handles requests like fetching market data, placing orders, and checking balances.
- **WebSocket API**: Provides real-time updates (e.g., live price feeds, order status).
- **Environments**:
  - **Production (India)**: `https://api.india.delta.exchange`
  - **Testnet (India)**: `https://cdn-ind.testnet.deltaex.org` (for testing without real funds)
  - **Global**: `https://api.delta.exchange` (for non-Indian users)

### 2.2 Authentication
- **Requirements**: API key and secret (generated from a Delta Exchange account).
- **Process**: Secure requests with an HMAC-SHA256 signature based on API secret, method, timestamp, path, query, and payload.
- **Example Code** (Python):
  import hashlib
  import hmac
  import requests
  import time

  base_url = 'https://api.india.delta.exchange'
  api_key = 'your_api_key'
  api_secret = 'your_api_secret'

  def generate_signature(secret, message):
      message = bytes(message, 'utf-8')
      secret = bytes(secret, 'utf-8')
      hash = hmac.new(secret, message, hashlib.sha256)
      return hash.hexdigest()

  # Example: Get open orders
  method = 'GET'
  timestamp = str(int(time.time()))
  path = '/v2/orders'
  query_string = '?product_id=1&state=open'
  payload = ''
  signature_data = method + timestamp + path + query_string + payload
  signature = generate_signature(api_secret, signature_data)

  req_headers = {
      'api-key': api_key,
      'timestamp': timestamp,
      'signature': signature,
      'User-Agent': 'python-rest-client',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }

  response = requests.get(f'{base_url}{path}{query_string}', headers=req_headers)
  print(response.json())
- **Developer Notes**:
  - Store API keys securely (e.g., in environment variables).
  - Use HTTPS for all requests.
  - Implement error handling for invalid keys or signatures.

### 2.3 Key Endpoints
- **Market Data**:
  - `/v2/assets`: List supported cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC, ETH).
  - `/v2/tickers`: Fetch real-time price data for trading pairs.
  - `/v2/l2orderbook`: Get buy/sell order book for an asset.
- **Account Management**:
  - `/v2/orders`: View or place orders.
  - `/v2/balances`: Check user account balances.
- **Trading**:
  - `POST /v2/orders`: Place a new trade (e.g., limit, market order).
  - `GET /v2/positions`: View open trading positions.
- **Developer Notes**:
  - Use these endpoints to build features like price displays, order forms, and account dashboards.
  - Cache responses (e.g., market data) to reduce API calls.

### 2.4 WebSocket API
- **Purpose**: Real-time updates for prices, trades, or order status.
- **Key Channels**:
  - `l2_orderbook`: Real-time order book updates.
  - `trades`: Recent trade data.
- **Implementation**: Use libraries like `websocket-client` (Python) or `WebSocket` (JavaScript).
- **Developer Notes**: Handle disconnections (common user complaint) with automatic reconnection logic.

### 2.5 Rate Limits
- API enforces limits to prevent abuse (e.g., too many requests per second).
- Exceeding limits returns `429 Too Many Requests`.
- **Developer Notes**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff to handle rate limits.

### 2.6 Testnet
- **URL**: `https://cdn-ind.testnet.deltaex.org`
- **Purpose**: Simulate trading without real funds.
- **Developer Notes**: Use testnet for all development and testing to avoid financial risks.

## 3. Website Development Guidelines

### 3.1 Frontend Features
- **User Interface**:
  - Display real-time prices and order books (`/v2/tickers`, `/v2/l2orderbook`).
  - Show account balances and trade history (`/v2/balances`, `/v2/orders`).
  - Provide forms for placing trades (e.g., buy/sell with limit/market options).
- **Charts**: Use libraries like Chart.js or TradingView for price charts.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure compatibility with mobile and desktop (aligned with Delta Exchange’s mobile apps).

### 3.2 Backend Features
- **API Integration**:
  - Connect to REST API for data retrieval and trading.
  - Use WebSocket for real-time updates.
  - Implement authentication logic (as shown in example).
- **Security**:
  - Store API keys in environment variables or a secrets manager.
  - Use HTTPS and validate all user inputs.
  - Implement user authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT) for account access.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handle API errors (e.g., `429`, `401`).
  - Display user-friendly error messages.

### 3.3 Database (Optional)
- Store user preferences, trade history, or cached API data (e.g., in MySQL, MongoDB).
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) to optimize performance and reduce API calls.

### 3.4 Testing
- Use testnet API for all testing.
- Test edge cases (e.g., invalid API keys, rate limits, network failures).
- Simulate WebSocket disconnections and verify reconnection logic.

### 3.5 Potential Challenges
- **WebSocket Disconnections**: Users report frequent app disconnections (every 30 seconds). Implement robust reconnection logic.
- **API Key Management**: Guide users to generate and input API keys via Delta Exchange’s account settings.
- **KYC**: Delta Exchange requires KYC verification. Include UI elements to guide users through KYC or display status.

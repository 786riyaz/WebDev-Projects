API Environments:
Production (India): https://api.india.delta.exchange – For real trading.
Testnet (India): https://cdn-ind.testnet.deltaex.org – For testing without real money.
Global APIs: Separate URLs for non-Indian users (e.g., https://api.delta.exchange).
For Developers: Use the Testnet for development and testing to avoid risking real funds. Your client’s website should allow users to switch between testnet and production environments.
